"I'll be fine," I said.

"I'll walk you home," he said.

"No," I said.

"Why?" he asked.

"I don't want you to," I said.

"Why?" he asked.

"I don't want you to," I said.

"Why?" he asked.

"I don't want you to," I said.

"Why?" he asked.

"Because," I said.

"Because why?" he asked.

"Because you're leaving and I don't want you to," I said.

He stared at me.

"I'm leaving in two days," he said.

"I know," I said.

"You're going to be okay, aren't you?" he asked.

"I'll be fine," I said. "I'll be fine."

"I'll walk you home," he said.

"No," I said.

"You're not going to be alone at night," he said.

"I'll be fine," I said.

He sighed.

"I'll walk you home," he said.

"No," I said.

"Yes," he said.

"No," I said.

"It's not safe," he said.

"I'll be fine," I said.

"I'll walk you home," he said.

"No," I said.

"Yes," he said.

"No," I said.

"Yes," he said.

"No," I said.

"Because why?" he asked.

"Because you're leaving and I don't want you to," I said.

"I'm leaving in two days," he said.

I nodded.

"I know," I said.

"You're going to be okay, aren't you?" he asked.

"I'll be fine," I said. "I'll be fine."
